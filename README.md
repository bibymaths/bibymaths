# Hi there, I'm Abhinav! 👋

I’m a bioinformatics wizard 🧙‍♂️ who loves to mix science, code, and a sprinkle of chaos to tackle big questions in biology. From cancer research 🧬 to dopamine pathways 🧠, my journey has been as dynamic as the proteins I model!

## Who Am I? 🤔

- 🔬 **Bioinformatics Mastermind**: Freshly brewed from Freie Universität Berlin, with a knack for modeling, optimization, and systems biology.
- 🧑‍💻 **Code Alchemist**: Turning ideas into elegant Python scripts, magical Julia code, and sometimes deciphering Bash spells.
- 🌱 **Lifelong Learner**: Currently exploring Julia and PKPD models, because science never sleeps (and neither do I after a good coffee ☕).

## Fun Facts About Me 😎

- 🎸 When I’m not cracking biological puzzles, you’ll find me strumming my **ukulele** or debating philosophy. 
- 🌌 A proud believer that data is the closest thing we have to the Force in real life. May the p-value be ever in your favor!
- 🧩 My favorite pastime? Making sense of messy datasets. It’s like solving a Rubik’s cube, but nerdier.

## Skills & Technologies

- **Languages**: Julia, Python, R, Bash, Perl
- **Tools**: Samtools, BAMtools, GATK, Conda, LaTeX
- **Specializations**: High-throughput data analysis, omics analysis, comparative genomics, machine learning, applied statistics, drug discovery, and data visualization.
