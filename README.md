âœ¨ Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a **computational biologist and open-science advocate**, motivated by mathematics and programming to transform
biological complexity into computationally tractable problems. I integrate multi-omics data, build optimization-driven
models that link molecular networks to drug responses, and develop open-source pipelines using high-performance
computing, containerization, and workflow systems.

I hold an **MSc in Bioinformatics from Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin (2025)** and a **BTech in Bioinformatics from Jaypee
University of Information Technology, India (2017)**.

Professionally, I have:

* Built and validated an optimization framework to reconstruct phosphorylation networks in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
  using proteomics data 
* Developed a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for drug distribution in the human body ([Preprint](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14976788))
* Tested a pipeline for prostate cancer biomarker discovery using gene expression data and pathway analysis, 
  leading ([Publication](https://doi.org/10.1515/jib-2018-0080)).   
* Designed a docking workflow to screen FDA-approved drugs against the dopamine D3 receptor for potential repurposing in Schizophrenia 

You can find these and more on my [portfolio](https://bibymaths.github.io/portfolio/)
and [projects](https://bibymaths.github.io/projects/) pages, where I also share open-source tools for phosphoproteomics
analysis, viral genome reconstruction, genomic mapping, codon usage analysis, sequence alignment, and liver cancer
prediction.

Iâ€™m always glad to connect with others in bioinformatics, computational biology, and open science. Looking ahead, I aim
to expand my modeling and integration methods toward **precision medicine**, where predictive models can guide
real-world clinical decisions.
