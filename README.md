# Hi there, I'm Abhinav

I’m a bioinformatics enthusiast who loves to mix science, code, and a bit of creative chaos to tackle complex questions in biology. From cancer research to dopamine pathways, my journey has been as dynamic as the proteins I model.

I hold a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics from Freie Universität Berlin, with a strong focus on modeling, optimization, and systems biology. I enjoy turning ideas into clean Python scripts, elegant Julia code, and occasionally decoding complex Bash workflows. As a lifelong learner, I’m currently diving deeper into Julia and sparse matrix operations in Python, revisiting cell biology and immunology, and thinking through new project ideas to bridge computation and biology.
